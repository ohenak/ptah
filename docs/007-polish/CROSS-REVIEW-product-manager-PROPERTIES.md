## Status Update from v1.1

**F-03 (wrong branch) — RESOLVED.** The PROPERTIES document was committed to `feat-007-polish` at commit `79f2f7f`. This blocking finding is closed.

All other Medium findings from v1.1 remain outstanding. The document was committed at v1.0 without addressing any review feedback. This v1.2 review reflects the current document state.

## Findings

### F-01 — Medium | Missing PROP-EX-21 — Hot-Reload Registry Rebuild Path Not Covered

**Status:** Unresolved from v1.1 F-01 (confirmed by BE Q-01, TE F-02, TE Q-01).

**Location:** §7 Gap #3; REQ-NF-08 acceptance criterion AT-EX-01-08.

**Issue:** The REQ-NF-08 acceptance criterion explicitly states the agent must be registered **"at next startup (or on config hot-reload)"** — hot-reload is a first-class product requirement. The document self-identifies this as Medium risk in §7 but promotes no property to cover it.

Without PROP-EX-21, the PLAN has no trackable Definition of Done item for this acceptance test. The BE confirmed TSPEC OQ-TSPEC-01 is resolved (the composition root supports registry rebuild on hot-reload). The TE confirmed the correct test level is **Integration** (requires wiring `NodeConfigLoader`, registry factory, and `DefaultRoutingEngine` together — fakes alone are insufficient).

**Required action:** Add the following property to §3.5 Integration Properties:

> **PROP-EX-21:** After a config hot-reload that removes an agent from `agents[]`, `DefaultRoutingEngine` must treat that agent's ID as unknown on the next routing decision and post an ERR-RP-02 Error Report embed to the originating thread.
> — Sources: [REQ-NF-08], [FSPEC-EX-01 §4.4], [AT-EX-01-08]; **Test Level: Integration**; Priority: P1

After adding PROP-EX-21: update §2 Integration count (3 → 4), §5.1 REQ-NF-08 row, §5.2 FSPEC-EX-01 row, §6 Integration count and pyramid. Grand total after all count corrections = **71**.

---

### F-02 — Medium | Property Count Discrepancy — §2 and §6 Under-Count by One

**Status:** Unresolved from v1.1 F-02 (confirmed by all three reviewers).

**Location:** §2 Property Summary table (Functional row, Total); §6 Test Level Distribution table.

**Issue:** Counting §3.1 sub-sections directly yields **33 Functional properties**:

| Sub-category | Properties | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Thread Archiving | PROP-DI-01..08 | 8 |
| Embed Formatting | PROP-DI-09..15 | 7 |
| Config-Driven Extensibility | PROP-EX-01..11 | 11 |
| Structured Logging | PROP-LG-01..03 | 3 |
| Error Message UX | PROP-RP-01..04 | 4 |
| **Sub-total** | | **33** |

§2 reports 32 Functional and a total of 69. The grand total is **70** (before adding PROP-EX-21), **71** after. This propagates to §6: Unit count should be 67 (not 66), total should be 70/71 depending on whether PROP-EX-21 is included.

The PLAN's Definition of Done gate will be derived from the §2 total. A gate set at 69 means one property will never be checked at completion — a DoD correctness failure.

**Required action:** Identify the off-by-one property (likely Config-Driven Extensibility: PROP-EX-01..11 = 11 entries, likely miscounted as 10). Correct §2 Functional to 33, correct §2 Total and §6 totals in a single pass incorporating F-01 — final grand total is **71**.

---

### F-03 — Low | Section Numbering Gap: §3.6 Missing

**Status:** Unresolved from v1.1 F-04 (confirmed by TE F-04).

**Location:** §3 Properties, section headers.

**Issue:** Document jumps from `3.5 Integration Properties` to `3.7 Security Properties`, skipping §3.6. The template defines a Performance section at position 3.6; Phase 7 has no performance properties but the numbering was not adjusted.

**Required action:** Either renumber `3.7 → 3.6`, `3.8 → 3.7`, `3.9 → 3.8` and update all cross-references; or insert a `3.6 Performance Properties` placeholder with a one-line note explaining why no performance properties are warranted for Phase 7.

---

### F-04 — Low | PROP-EX-18 Traceability — LLM Config Parsing Not in REQ-NF-08 Acceptance Criteria

**Status:** Unresolved from v1.1 F-05 (confirmed by TE F-07).

**Location:** §3.4 PROP-EX-18; §5.1 Coverage Matrix REQ-NF-08 row.

**Issue:** PROP-EX-18 asserts that the config loader parses `llm.model` and `llm.max_tokens`. REQ-NF-08 focuses exclusively on the `agents[]` array schema. Tracing PROP-EX-18 to REQ-NF-08 overstates the requirement scope — LLM config is a co-migrated schema concern but is not an REQ-NF-08 acceptance criterion.

**Required action (Low — editorial):** Retrace PROP-EX-18 source to `[TSPEC §5.2], [TSPEC §5.3]` as a companion schema migration data-integrity constraint. Add a note that this is a TSPEC-derived constraint rather than a direct REQ-NF-08 acceptance criterion.

---

### F-05 — Low | PROP-EX-17 Failure Mode Is Ambiguous for Test Authoring

**Status:** Unresolved from v1.1 F-06 (confirmed by BE F-03, TE F-06).

**Location:** §3.4, PROP-EX-17.

**Issue:** "Reject (or not parse)" is a disjunction between two fundamentally different test implementations: `expect(fn).rejects.toThrow(...)` (hard rejection) vs. `expect(result.value).not.toHaveProperty('active')` (silent omission). Per TSPEC §5.1/5.3, the correct behavior is silent key omission by the Zod schema parser.

**Required action (Low — editorial):** Rewrite to be unambiguous:

> "Config loader must parse `agents[]` using the new array schema; the old flat `AgentConfig` keys (`active`, `skills`, `colours`, `role_mentions`) must be absent from the parsed config object — they are silently dropped by the schema parser, not thrown."

---

### F-06 — Low | Redundant Sub-Range in §5.1 REQ-NF-08 Coverage Row

**Status:** Unresolved from v1.1 F-07 (confirmed by BE F-02, TE F-05).

**Location:** §5.1 Requirement Coverage, REQ-NF-08 row; §5.2 FSPEC-EX-01 row.

**Issue:** `PROP-EX-01..20, PROP-EX-12..19` — the range `PROP-EX-12..19` is fully subsumed by `PROP-EX-01..20`. Same redundant notation in §5.2.

**Required action:** Remove `PROP-EX-12..19` from both §5.1 and §5.2.

---

### F-07 — Low | Gap #1 Should Be Elevated to a Named Negative Property (New — from TE F-08)

**Status:** New finding from TE F-08 (not in prior PM review).

**Location:** §7 Gap #1; §4 Negative Properties.

**Issue:** Gap #1 (`postSystemMessage()` removal) is correctly identified as a risk in §7. Without a named negative property, the PLAN has no trackable DoD item verifying that this method is removed from the `ResponsePoster` protocol. A grep check in the PLAN is fragile — it requires manual coordination with the test script author. A named property forces the PLAN author to explicitly verify the interface change.

**Recommended action (Low — editorial):** Add:

> **PROP-DI-N05:** `ResponsePoster` protocol must NOT expose `postSystemMessage()` — the method must be absent from the interface definition and all implementing classes.
> — Sources: [TSPEC §4.2.2]; Test Level: Unit (TypeScript compile-time); Priority: P1

This converts Gap #1 from an open risk to a closed, trackable item.

## Clarification Questions

*None — all questions from v1.1 are resolved:*

- **F-03 branch discrepancy (v1.1):** RESOLVED — document is on `feat-007-polish`.
- **PROP-EX-21 test level:** Integration confirmed by BE Q-01 and TE Q-01.

---

## Positive Observations

- **Comprehensive property coverage.** All 6 P1 requirements are fully covered. The 1:1 mapping from FSPEC-OB-01's 10 lifecycle events to PROP-OB-03 through PROP-OB-12 is precisely what operator observability verification requires.

- **Negative properties section (§4) is a standout.** Nine negative properties across four domains — including subtle invariants like no manual component prefix injection (PROP-LG-N01) and no type redefinition in logger.ts (PROP-LG-N02) — encode the classes of accidental regressions hardest to catch without explicit test hooks.

- **Security properties operationalize the requirement well.** PROP-RP-08/09/10 form a three-layer defense — output shape, function signature constraint, and name-sourcing rules — ensuring the REQ-RP-06 intent cannot be defeated by a partial implementation.

- **Integration property PROP-LG-06 (shared FakeLogStore)** is the right foundational design for observability tests. Without this property, per-component log isolation would silently make the PROP-DI-21 EVT-OB-01..10 trace invisible from a single assertion point.

- **Self-identified gaps in §7 demonstrate strong discipline.** All three reviewers validated the assessments. The process worked as intended; the remaining step is incorporating those gaps before the PLAN is written.

## Recommendation

**Needs revision.**

Two Medium findings must be resolved before this document is approved:

1. **F-01** — Add PROP-EX-21 (hot-reload Integration property); update §2 Integration count (3 → 4), §5.1 REQ-NF-08 row, §5.2 FSPEC-EX-01 row, §6 pyramid.
2. **F-02** — Fix property count discrepancy: §2 Functional (32 → 33), Total corrected. Address F-01 and F-02 in a single pass — final corrected grand total is **71** (70 after count fix +1 for PROP-EX-21).

Low-severity findings (F-03 through F-07) should be addressed in the same revision pass.

**Previously blocking F-03 (wrong branch) is now RESOLVED** — the document is on `feat-007-polski`. Once F-01 and F-02 are resolved, this document can be approved without further PM review.

**Required before approval:**
- [ ] Add PROP-EX-21 (Integration, P1); update §2 Integration (3 → 4), §5.1, §5.2, §6
- [ ] Fix §2 Functional count (32 → 33) and correct all totals (grand total → 71 after both fixes)
- [ ] Fix §6 Unit count (66 → 67) and grand total (69 → 71)

**Recommended (Low severity — same pass):**
- [ ] Fix section numbering §3.7→§3.6, §3.8→§3.7, §3.9→§3.8 [F-03]
- [ ] Retrace PROP-EX-18 source to TSPEC §5.2/5.3, not REQ-NF-08 [F-04]
- [ ] Clarify PROP-EX-17 to specify silent schema drop, not throw [F-05]
- [ ] Remove redundant `PROP-EX-12..19` range from §5.1 and §5.2 [F-06]
- [ ] Elevate Gap #1 to named negative property PROP-DI-N05 [F-07]
